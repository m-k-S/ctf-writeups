Writeup:
  A quick look at the provided source code shows us that the flag will be printed upon meeting two conditions. First, 5 random bytes are provided,
  and we must create a string whose first 5 bytes match after being hashed using md5. Since 5 bytes is a very small size, it's very simple to brute
  force this and send it back to the server.

  Next, 40 lists of numbers are provided, with the prompt: 'Enter solution as "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6"'
  Another look at the source shows us that these lists are generated by learn_with_vibrations(), along with the key to the flag.
  We can see that both the key and the first 6 numbers in the lists are generated randomly - however, the last number in each list is generated via some modular arithmetic.
  Working backwards, we just need to find a set of 6 numbers to multiply with the first 6 numbers in each list given, that could yield the 7th number.
  
  This is just a matter of replicating the operations - multiplying numbers with corresponding indices, taking the sum of all 6 products, taking that modulo 8, and then shifting it -1, 0, or 1
  Doing this for all 40 lists will give you about 3.5 million possible keys - finding the real one is just a matter of checking for the list that appears 40 times.
  Sending this to the server yields the flag: INS{ErrorsOccurMistakesAreMade}

Python Code:
